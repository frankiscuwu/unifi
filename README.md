## Overview

**Unifi** is a collaborative web platform that enables users to listen to music together while automatically curating a shared playlist that reflects everyone’s unique tastes.  
The system intelligently merges multiple users’ preferences, creating a seamless and social group listening experience powered by real-time updates and AI-driven recommendations.

---

## What It Does

Unifi allows users to connect in shared music rooms where each participant’s favorite tracks and listening data contribute to a unified playlist.  
When new users join, the playlist dynamically adjusts to include their preferences.  
Users can interact through text or voice to request songs, set moods, or influence the overall direction of the mix — ensuring everyone hears music they love while discovering new sounds introduced by others in the room.

---

## How We Built It

Unifi is built with **Next.js** and **React** for a modern, performant frontend and API layer.  
The backend uses **MongoDB** (hosted on **Railway**) for persistent data storage, while the app is deployed on **Vercel** for seamless global delivery.  

We integrated the **Spotify Web API** for real-time playback and playlist management.  
AI-driven personalization and natural language understanding are powered by **Google Gemini**, and **ElevenLabs** provides high-quality text-to-speech output for the AI DJ persona.

## What's Next for Unifi

- Implement **WebSocket-based real-time synchronization** for playback, playlist updates, and live interactions.  
- Introduce **individual music rooms** with unique access codes for private or group sessions.  
- Expand AI capabilities to support dynamic conversation, contextual playlist shaping, and adaptive sound environments.
