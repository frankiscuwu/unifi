## üöÄ Overview

**Unifi** is a collaborative music platform that enables users to listen to music together, dynamically curating a shared Spotify playlist that best reflects everyone‚Äôs unique tastes.  
The system merges multiple users‚Äô preferences to create a seamless and social group listening experience powered by real-time updates and AI-DJ recommendations.

---

## ‚ú® What It Does

Unifi allows users to connect in shared music rooms where each participant‚Äôs favorite tracks and listening data contribute to a unified playlist.  
When new users join, the playlist dynamically adjusts to include their preferences. Users can update the playlist by interacting through text or voice to request songs, set moods, or influence the overall direction of the mix.

---

## üß© How We Built It

Unifi is built with **Next.js** and **React** for a modern, performant frontend and API layer.  
The backend uses **MongoDB** (hosted on **Railway**) for persistent data storage, while the app is deployed on **Vercel** for seamless global delivery.  

We integrated the **Spotify Web API** for real-time playback and playlist management.  
AI-driven personalization and natural language understanding are powered by **Google Gemini**, and **ElevenLabs** provides high-quality text-to-speech output for the AI DJ persona.
